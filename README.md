RxJava extension for Android to access camera and gallery to take images. 

# RxPaparazzo

What is a Paparazzo?

> A freelance photographer who aggressively pursues celebrities for the purpose of taking candid photographs.

This library does that. Not really. But it was a funny name, thought. Was it?


## Features:
 
- Runtime permissions. Not worries about the tricky Android runtime permissions system. RxPaparazzo relies on [RxPermissions](https://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions) to deal with that.  
- Take a photo using the built-in camera.
- Access to gallery. 
- Crop images. RxPaparazzo relies on [UCrop](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop) to perform beautiful cuts to any face, body or place. 
- Honors the observable chain (it means you can go crazy chaining operators). [RxOnActivityResult](https://github.com/VictorAlbertos/RxActivityResult) allows RxPaparazzo to transform every intent into an observable for a wonderful chaining process.


## Setup
Add the JitPack repository in your build.gradle (top level module):
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

And add next dependencies in the build.gradle of the module:
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.scijoker:RxPaparazzo:0.1.8.2'
    compile "io.reactivex:rxjava:1.1.5"
}
```


## Usage
Because RxPaparazzo uses RxActivityResult to deal with intent calls, all its requirements and features are inherited too.

Before attempting to use RxPaparazzo, you need to call `RxPaparazzo.register` in your Android `Application` class, supplying as parameter the current instance.
        
```java
public class SampleApp extends Application {

    @Override public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        RxPaparazzo.register(this);
    }
}
```

Every feature RxPaparazzo exposes can be accessed from both, an `activity` or a `fragment` instance. 

**Limitation:**: Your fragments need to extend from `android.support.v4.app.Fragment` instead of `android.app.Fragment`, otherwise they won't be notified. 

The generic type of the `observable` returned by RxPaparazzo when subscribing to any of its features is always an instance of [Response](https://github.com/FuckBoilerplate/RxPaparazzo/blob/master/rx_paparazzo/src/main/java/com/fuck_boilerplate/rx_paparazzo/entities/Response.java) class. 

This instance holds a reference to the current Activity/Fragment, accessible calling `targetUI()` method. Because the original one may be recreated it would be unsafe calling it. Instead, you must call any method/variable of your Activity/Fragment from this instance encapsulated in the `response` instance.

Also, this instance holds a reference to the data as the appropriate response, as such as the result code of the specific operation.

### Calling built-in camera to take a photo.
```java
RxPaparazzo.takeImage(activityOrFragment)
        .usingCamera()
        .subscribe(response -> {
            if (response.resultCode() != RESULT_OK) {
                response.targetUI().showUserCanceled();
                return;
            }

            response.targetUI().loadImage(response.data());
        });
```

The `response` instance holds a reference to the path where the image was persisted.

By default, the path is under app name folder on the root of the external storage, but you can save the images in internal storage by using `.useInternalStorage()`


### Calling the gallery to retrieve an image.
```java
RxPaparazzo.takeImage(activityOrFragment)
        .usingGallery()
        .subscribe(response -> {
            if (response.resultCode() != RESULT_OK) {
                response.targetUI().showUserCanceled();
                return;
            }

            response.targetUI().loadImage(response.data());
        });
```

The `response` instance holds a reference to the path where the image was persisted. Same as the previous example. 

### Calling the gallery to retrieve multiple image 
```java
RxPaparazzo.takeImages(activityOrFragment)
        .usingGallery()
        .subscribe(response -> {
            if (response.resultCode() != RESULT_OK) {
                response.targetUI().showUserCanceled();
                return;
            }

            if (response.data().size() == 1) response.targetUI().loadImage(response.data().get(0));
            else response.targetUI().loadImages(response.data());
        });
```

The `response` instance holds a reference to the paths where the images were persisted.

**Note**: if the level Android api device is minor than 18, only one image will be retrieved. 

## Customizations
When asking RxPaparazzo for an image -whether it was retrieved using the built-in camera or via gallery, it's possible to apply some configurations to the action. 

### Size options
`Size` values `enum` can be used to set the size of the image to retrieve. There are 3 options:

* Small: 1/8 aprox. of the screen resolution
* Screen: The size image matches aprox. the screen resolution.
* Original: The original size of the image.

`Screen` value will be set as default.

```java
RxPaparazzo.takeImages(activityOrFragment)
                .size(Size.Small)
                .usingGallery()
```                 
                
### Cropping support for image.
This feature is available thanks to the amazing library [uCrop](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop) authored by [Yalantis](https://github.com/Yalantis) group. 

```java
RxPaparazzo.takeImages(activityOrFragment)
                .crop()
``` 

By calling `crop()` method when building the observable instance, all they images retrieved will be able to be cropped, regardless if the images were retrieved using the built-in camera or gallery, even if multiple images were requested in a single call using `takeImages()` approach.
Because uCrop Yalantis library exposes some configuration in order to customize the crop screen, RxPaparazzo exposes an overloaded method of `crop(UCrop.Options)` which allow to pass an instance of [UCrop.Options](https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop/blob/master/ucrop/src/main/java/com/yalantis/ucrop/UCrop.java#L211).
If you need to configure the aspect ratio, the max result size or using the source image aspect ratio, you must pass an instance of [Options](https://github.com/FuckBoilerplate/RxPaparazzo/blob/master/rx_paparazzo/src/main/java/com/fuck_boilerplate/rx_paparazzo/entities/Options.java) class, which extends from `UCrop.Options` and adds the three missing properties.  

```java
UCrop.Options options = new UCrop.Options();
options.setToolbarColor(ContextCompat.getColor(getActivity(), R.color.colorPrimaryDark));

RxPaparazzo.takeImage(activityOrFragment).crop(options)
```

```java
Options options = new Options();
options.setToolbarColor(ContextCompat.getColor(getActivity(), R.color.colorPrimaryDark));
options.setAspectRatio(25, 50); 

RxPaparazzo.takeImage(activityOrFragment)
         .crop(options)
```
